codeigniter-multidomain
=======================

This is a simple replacement implementation of the Router class, allowing you to match against 
domain names in addition to the already-present pathnames.

This will not be backwards-compatible with your existing config/router.php

-----------------
routes.php format
-----------------

routes.php is relatively similar to the old routes.php format, however, it is not backwards-compatible.

$routes is now a 2-dimensional array. The first part of the array is a regex matching the domain 
name, and the second is a regex matching the pathname. The values must be strings pointing to a 
controller in the controllers/ directory.

See example_application/config/config.php for a very simple example.

In addition, without any routes set up, for an URL http://www.example.com/hi/foo/bar/method/param1,
the application will do the following:
* Check to see that controllers/www.example.com/hi is a directory - if it is then:
* Check to see that controllers/www.example.com/hi/foo is a directory - if it is then:
* Check to see that controllers/www.example.com/hi/foo/bar is a directory - if it is not then:
* Check to see that controllers/www.example.com/hi/foo/bar.php is a file - if it is, then use that as a controller

It will also run "common" controllers on any domain - these controllers should be put in the root 
controllers/ directory.
